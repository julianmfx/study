# 🗂️ Wiki Structure

Below is the current layout (subject to change as the project grows):

1. **Introduction** – Big‑picture overview and purpose.
2. **Wiki Structure** – You are here: explains how pages are organised and linked.
3. **Topics Being Addressed** – What we already cover in depth.
4. **Topics To Be Addressed** – A public backlog of future articles or enhancements.
5. **What Can Be Better** – Continuous‑improvement log and open questions.

### Naming convention

* Pages are prefixed with two‑digit indices (`00‑`, `01‑`, …) to keep the sidebar logically ordered.
* Use `Title-Case-With-Dashes.md` for new pages.
