Welcome to the **Study Wiki**!  

Our goal is to provide clear, concise, and ever‑evolving information about the beautiful fields of Data Anlytics, Data Science, Data Engineering, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that helps **all users**—from absolute beginners to seasoned contributors—navigate this Study project.

> **Why this wiki?**

> * Centralises quality and easily accessible knowledge because most information in the internet is incomplete, unsatisfactory, dispersed and paid.

> * Enables transparent, review‑driven improvements via pull requests.

> * Scales from quick notes to full tutorials.

Feel free to fork the repo, open an issue, or submit a pull request if you spot anything to improve.
