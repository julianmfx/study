## 🌟 Why this wiki?

* **Centralised quality knowledge** – most online info is incomplete, scattered or pay-walled; we keep it free and in one place.  
* **Transparent improvements** – everything happens via Pull Requests, so every edit is reviewed and traceable.  
* **Scales with you** – grows seamlessly from quick notes to full tutorials thanks to MkDocs + Material.
